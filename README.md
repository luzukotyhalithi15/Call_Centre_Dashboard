# Call_Centre_Dashboard
The Call-Center-Dashboard_Final.xlsx project is about analyzing and visualizing the performance of a customer service or call center operation.
📌 What the Project Covers
This type of dashboard typically brings together key operational metrics to help managers monitor efficiency and customer satisfaction. The data usually includes:
• 	Call volumes – number of incoming and outgoing calls over time.
• 	Response times – average speed of answer, wait times, and handling times.
• 	Agent performance – calls handled per agent, resolution rates, and productivity.
• 	Customer outcomes – satisfaction scores, first-call resolution rates, and escalations.
• 	Operational trends – peak hours, busiest days, and regional differences.
🎯 Purpose
The goal of the project is to provide a real-time, visual overview of call center operations. By consolidating data into charts, KPIs, and dashboards, managers can quickly identify bottlenecks, track service quality, and make informed decisions to improve efficiency and customer experience.
📊 Typical Insights
• 	Which agents or teams are performing best.
• 	When call volumes spike and how staffing aligns with demand.
• 	Whether customers are satisfied with the service they receive.
• 	How quickly issues are resolved and where delays occur.
